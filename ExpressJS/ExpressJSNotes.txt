Express Framework that is built on the top of Node that going to help us create backend with ease.
Web Framework:
Node.js -> 46%
React.js -> 445
jQuery -> 29%
Express -> 23%

We can choose different languages and Framework for backend.
Node.js is not actually framework, rather it is runtime environment(enables the coe to run in the computer).

Express is the framework for the Javascript which helps to create backend for the websites.

Node can do bunch of things even the node is helping to run vscode in the computer.

So Express is specialiazed in building the backend with features like
    i. Readability
    ii. Less Code
    iii. MiddleWare


#Creating our First Server with Express
Backend: Applications,Server and Database
Application running in server computer

Client side and Server side

Making Server or backend using 
    Express + Node
    Local computer as a server.

Six step to create Express Server

    1. Create the directory
    2. Create index.js file
    3. Initialise NPM
    init npm -y
    4. Install the Express package
    npm i express
    5. Write Server Application in index.js
    6. Start server

import express from "express";
const app = express();

app.listen(3000, () => {
    //callback function after listining to the server
    console.log("Server running on port 3000);
});
3000 is the port which is the location of the server.

Localhost : when we don't have online server, we make it locally.
https://localhost:3000

Ports: Bucnh of doors on the server to access the server. We are listening to the port 3000.
Through that port it is ging to our computer.
Pinter might have different door.

We can find which port are listening:

netstat -ano | findstr"LISTENING"


HTTP : HyperText Transfer Protocol
Language that allows computer to talk to each other in the internet.
GET
POST
PUT
PATCH
DELETE

GET: request resource from the server
POST: Sending the resource to the server
PUT: Replace resource
PATCH: Patch up the resource
DELETE: Delete the resource from Client to Server side

When localhost:3000 is loaded we get,
Cannot GET/ 
because there is no any get function initialized on  the server side.
We can fix this by setting up the get as 
app.get("/", (req, res) =>){
    res.send("Hello World);
}

Nodemon:
npm i -g nodemon
Automaticall refresh the server when there is change in the file
nodemon index.js
/Endpoints
Where the localhost goes
